# Download_and_execute_payload

# When the file is executed it will download a number of files and execute them on a Linux or Windows computer. It can be used to download a various files, and execute them in the background. It can be used to show an image first to the user and then download other files in the background. 

# Please run the install.sh file first in order to download the required files required for program to work. Then run the payload.py to create the payload, and add in the arguments from the command line (Use -h for the options of the payload.py file)

# This program can currently be run from only LINUX interfaces 

# Hope this tool helps :)
